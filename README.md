# The Abyssal
A sea-born sorcerer brought in with the tide.  

The Abyssal is a fully fleshed-out custom class with a primary focus on deck control and mechanic synergies rather than raw power.

## Features of the Class
 - 80+ cards, with all-new artwork
 - custom animated character sprite
 - 1s+ new relics
 - 2 new potions
 
 ## Mechanics
 - Use your starter relic to get a Cannon to fight enemies with, or defer it until a later act to get a more powerful Cannon
 - Attack enemies with Cannonball cards which become more powerful with your Cannon
 - Apply Ink to enemies to reflect their damage back on themselves
 - Manipulate and control your deck through Bury and Dig mechanics, discarding cards from your draw pile and returning/upgrading cards from your discard pile
 - Lure powerful beasts to fight for you by putting debuff cards in your deck
